<h3>Sociocracy</h3>
Conceptualized by Auguste Comt√©, Sociocracy can be traced back to 1851. The movement has since remerged in modern times in 2014 as Sociocracy 3.0. It enables companies and teams to manage themselves as an organic whole meaning everyone gets a voice in the management of the organization. It is designed to grow effective, agile and resilient organizations of any size, from small startups to large international and national networks.
