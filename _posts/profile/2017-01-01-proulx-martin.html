bio: "I act as a strategist in transforming organizational cultures alongside leaders who want to improve the motivation, engagement and performances of their organization. At the core, I am a transformation accelerator, who implements an agile culture within organizations. As a former business executive and experienced leader, I had the opportunity to develop a methodology that combines team performance and employee engagement. Inspired by agile methods, I have contributed to the success of both large corporations and small and medium-sized businesses by establishing high-performing teams that have a direct impact on the success of their organizations. In developing intentional leadership, modifying the company’s conversation and increasing accountability, I significantly improve organizations’ performances. In other words, I instill the conditions that spark the natural motivation within people to attain the desired outcomes."
