bio: "I bring over 3 decades of global business experience in delivering high performance mindfulness training to business leaders and teams in large, fast-paced organisations. I have lived and worked in Dublin, Barcelona, New York, San Diego, Santiago de Chile and Colombia, and have been involved in founding & leading multiple start-ups as well as holding senior international management positions in technology, sales and marketing. I was founder of one of EuropeÂ´s first digital marketing agencies winning over 50 awards for excellence before being acquired in 2013. I also held senior management positions with Hewlett Packard driving 14 global product introductions for its digital imaging division. Since 2014, I have been focused on developing and delivering programs that unlock human potential to create better business results by focusing on mindset and mindfulness."
