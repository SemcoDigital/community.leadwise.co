bio: "<p>I am founder of creaffective an innovation consultancy running on Holacracy. I support organizations to enable and sustain creativity in the organization, in teams and in individuals. This includes looking at the culture of a company and in recent years also at the structural setup. A big part of my journey has been creaffective's shift to Holacracy as one building block to enable and sustain creativity for our own future. I am currently writing my third book focusing on innovation practices of self-organized companies.</p>"
