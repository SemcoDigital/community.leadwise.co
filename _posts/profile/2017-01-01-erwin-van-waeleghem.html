bio: "<p>professionally I still work as a fulltime police commissioner/criminologist in the City of Leuven (Belgium). Some other hats I wear, as a 'jobby', are that of ‘Tealspirator’, international Teal for Teal-steward and instigator of several initiatives towards more people centric and essential values based Leadership. I strongly believe in the leadership potential of every person which is also based on focussing on the essential human values and strong balance between intuition and rational common sense, we all carry inside of us. I internationally give introduction sessions, lectures and presentations on the Teal and Semco style principles. Next to Semco, I use a great number of wonderful and successful examples, which inspire a lot of people out of their authenticity. I am co-founder of the Teal for Teal International Foundation and hold the role of international inspirational steward in that community. In future I will be closely involved in the Semco Style Institute.</p>"
