bio: "<p>I've always believed that everyone deserves to be happy. If we're going to be spending a majority of our time on this earth in a work environment, then we should be able to enjoy that time. This is the philosophy that has driven me into organizational design. I want to help businesses discover that it is possible to be successful while also ensuring that your employees are living fulfilling lives. With my background in engineering, design, and operations, I have the skills and knowledge to help businesses focus on  purpose and help teams work more effectively in pursuit of that purpose.</p>"
