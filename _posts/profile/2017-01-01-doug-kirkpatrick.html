bio: "<p>On the first day of first grade, our teacher asked us to color a picture of a buffalo in brown crayon. Feeling creative, I used black and brown crayons, earning a reprimand. Ever since, I’ve been fascinated with the tension between organizational freedom and accountability. After college, I was privileged to serve as the first financial controller for Morning Star, now the world’s largest tomato processing company. Our founder introduced the startup team to the core principles of self-management, which we adopted immediately. At Morning Star, I learned that organizational self-management is real, it works and it drives superior business performance. I love to work collaboratively with like-minded colleagues who are passionate about shaping the people-centric workplaces of tomorrow.</p>"
