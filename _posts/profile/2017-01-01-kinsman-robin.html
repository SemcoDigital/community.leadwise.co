bio: "<p>Raised in many countries of LatinAmerica, I settled in Chile after University, where I majored in an interdisciplinary program, Political and Social Thought. Answering simple questions after years in Chile, such as \"where are from and what do you do?\" always produce in me a complex reflection, even for a quick answer. These normal interactions, repeated over the years, have given me a sensitivity to the universal need for an answer to these questions. A MA in Organizational Leadership gave me an additional perspective: our identity and our work have great potential for expression in companies. Today, I agree that our companies miss out on this very thing - the need for meaning and significance in work. I founded Embarka 5 years ago to help people in life design, and entrepreneurs in company building: this is my 3rd version, after failure. I am here because I want to be with those who are building a new culture for the future, to learn from and contribute to.</p>
