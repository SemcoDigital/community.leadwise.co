bio: "<p>I am a Dutch entrepreneur, public speaker and inspirator, driven by entrepreneurship and innovation. My mission? Encouraging the culture, entrepreneurship, personal growth and innovation that's needed to be successful in our WEconomy. It's time for a more people centric approach of our business, because our exponential world, with circular business models, needs new standards. To meet the disruptive demands that millennials, well informed critical customers and exponential new competitors ask from us, we need to work from a basis of trust and reduced control to speed up our innovation rate. For this reason, I decided early 2016 together with, amongst others, my business partner, the Brazilian entrepreneur Ricardo Semler, to become co-founder and Chief Inspiration Officer of the Semco Style Institute.</p>"
