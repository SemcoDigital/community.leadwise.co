bio: "<p>I'm involved with people and communication since 1999. I have a long-range vision. I quickly find meaningful patterns in things, and I'm well on conveying visions to people. My overall goal is to design decision-making conversations in order to make sense of why organizations exist and how their people creates value, and flourish. I'm independent, skeptical, critical and I have high standards of competence and performance for myself and others.</p>"
