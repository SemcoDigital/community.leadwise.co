bio: "<p>I help small and medium size business owners build outstanding organisations. I help them do this by creating a work environment where people thrive through exercising and living their highest values as human beings, and not through fear and greed. I came across Ricardo's book 'Maverick' in 1998, which made me reflect and realise that what he was saying in it - is what I had always deeply believed in, and had worked with intuitively all my life. I chose to leave my engineering/ sales career to specialise in HR (1999 - 2001). I was in Ricardo's Session at the Taj Hotel, Mumbai in 2002. It was in my last corporate role (CNBC TV18 - which transformed into Network18 Media) that I was able to bring 'people-magic' to life in full measure. (Network18 was the Best Place to Work in Media in India: 2008 & 2009) I'm here to make the people-magic happen in many, many more workplaces!</p>"
