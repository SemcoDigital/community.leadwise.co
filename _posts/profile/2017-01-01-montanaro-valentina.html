bio: "<p>Friends often describe me as an incurable optimist. I have been trying to fight injustice my whole life, hoping to make the world a better place. I have recently decided to become a freelance and look for an alternative as I was increasingly unhappy with the way NGOs and their old-fashioned structures work. I am here because I want the world to be a happier, healthier and fairer place. I feel we are losing our humanity, and I believe we must reshape the future starting from people and the way we organise and work.</p>"
